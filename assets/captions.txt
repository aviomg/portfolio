first time trying my hand at tapestry crochet

a hat for my naani | this was a very full circle moment; when I was younger, I didn't own a single hat, scarf, or pair of gloves that wasn't knit by my naani.

some random squares

a headband I made for my bhabi | it ended up being way too small (lol) but my neice got some use out of it.

my first hat! for my then-8-month niece

a lavender
