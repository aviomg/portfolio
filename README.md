# Personal Website, version 1

The first edition  of my personal site, built in the traditional HTML/CSS/JS stack, before I upgraded & expanded it using modern frameworks. This project solidified my understanding of the core logic at play in web browsers, and a true appreciation of how far we've come today, with frameworks that make web dev practically intuititve (like React and Next).
