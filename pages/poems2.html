Realities where I don’t get better, where I am sick forever and the sadness settles in and the eating disorder consumes me and none of my friends ever come</p><p>back. no</p><p>instead I am here in the present, on the roof where enemies are the concrete, as far away as they can get; my fears as detached as the shoes I kicked off my feet. I can feel a rumble shake the ground where I sit; it must be cars on their way in or out, little people excitedly on their way out of here or reluctantly on their way in (I’d hope the former). The pain has lifted for a moment…I’m trying to savor it, relish rather than demolish it. I’m holding back my hunger in fear that I’ll scare the clarity away. Its worth it.</p></div></div></article><article id="poem11" class="poem-container"><h1 class="poem-head" id="heading"><p>Haiku #1</p></h1><div id="body1"><div class="poem-para"><p>6 am, time’s up</p><p>the sun will be too, soon. she</p><p>longs for my return.</p></div></div></article><article id="poem12" class="poem-container"><h1 class="poem-head" id="heading"><p>Haiku #2</p></h1><div id="body1"><div class="poem-para"><p>Sentimental; a</p><p>Feeling, but for me, more of</p><p>A state of being</p></div></div></article><article id="poem13" class="poem-container"><h1 class="poem-head" id="heading"><p>Haiku #3</p></h1><div id="body1"><div class="poem-para"><p>an inherently</p><p>negative word, change. if it</p><p>were any good, they’d call it</p><p>growth instead.</p></div></div></article><article id="poem14" class="poem-container"><h1 class="poem-head" id="heading"><p>Hands of the clock</p></h1><div id="body1"><div class="poem-para"><p>I’m writing the hands of the clock into ice, into a still image my own,</p><p>I want them to stay</p><p>still, I want to stay here. my own hands shake as I whittle away</p><p>into sculpture, ice sculpture, frozen, still, I’m stuck, I’m frozen in</p><p>wait</p><p>Isn’t this what I wanted?</p></div><div class="poem-para"><p>I started taking pictures without looking at the screen, I’m hoping to capture</p><p>what my eyes can’t relay</p></div><div class="poem-para"><p>I’m in waiting, I don’t know what for.
